The data behind Moore's law
===========================
***Data & graphs on the progress of technology; visualizing the road to the singularityâ„¢***

This repository collates and visualizes data sets which demonstrate the increasing trends of computing power, storage capacity, astronomical surveys, etc.  The aim of these graphs is to encourage discussions related to *Moore's law* to be based on data, rather than assumptions or hear-say.  

The various sources behind the data points are documented inside the `data` directory of this repository, and the graphs can be reproduced using the included `plot_progress.py` script.

## The Graphs

### Computing power

![Supercomputer speeds double every 13 months](https://github.com/barentsen/tech-progress-data/blob/master/graphs/fastest-supercomputer.png)

![CPU transistor counts double every 23 months](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barentsen/tech-progress-data/master/graphs/transistor-counts.png)

### Storage & I/O

![Internet speeds double every 16 months](https://github.com/barentsen/tech-progress-data/blob/master/graphs/research-internet-speed.png)

![Storage-per-dollar ratios double every 23 months](https://github.com/barentsen/tech-progress-data/blob/master/graphs/disk-drive-price.png)

![Storage bus speeds double every 35 months](https://github.com/barentsen/tech-progress-data/blob/master/graphs/storage-bus-speed.png)

### Astronomical surveys

![Pixel rates of near-infrared astronomy surveys double every 41 months](https://github.com/barentsen/tech-progress-data/blob/master/graphs/telescope-pixel-counts-near-infrared.png)

![Pixel rates of optical astronomical surveys double every 41 months](https://github.com/barentsen/tech-progress-data/blob/master/graphs/telescope-pixel-counts.png)

### Biology
